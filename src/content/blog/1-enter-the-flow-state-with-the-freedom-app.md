Not that I'm bragging, but I can confidently say that I'm in world top 10 when it comes to professional, competetive procrastination. Okay, not sure about the world, but in my city I'm definitely top 5.

As much as it's nice to brag about this in front of my family, friends, or potential employers (also being a member of the procrastination club often earns me cool things like discounts in McDonald's), sometimes it would be nice to check off at least one task from the never-ending to-do list.

But what do you do if Jocko Willink isn't sitting next to you, shouting Full Metal Jacket style, that discipline is the key to freedom? Well, I don't know, maybe try creating an account on **<a href="https://freedom.sjv.io/Wq9dYn" target="_blank">Freedom</a>**?

## The Need

The goal was simple: find a **cross-platform solution that would make it as easy as possible to enter "deep work" mode**.

ðŸ’¡ _Deep work_ is a fancy way of saying: turn off the TikTok and do your job ðŸ¥¸. If you want to read more, you can check out this <a href="https://www.paniswojegoczasu.pl/rozwoj-osobisty/praca-gleboka/" target="_blank">article</a>.

This topic aligns with my recent interest in automation and better time management in general, so there will definitely be more apps and programs that have been recently running in parallel with Freedom.

## Advantages of Freedom

In the past, I had the opportunity to use similar solutions (e.g., <a href="https://selfcontrolapp.com/" target="_blank">SelfControl</a>), and I know that this _self-blocking technique_ works quite well for me. However, for some reason, I never stuck with a specific solution for longer. There was always something that didn't quite fit, and since lately, I've caught myself opening a new tab and typing in [*awful--horrible-and-time-stealing-website*].com almost automatically, something had to be done!

Freedom is great. It's very simple and minimalist, yet it has everything I was looking for. I've been using this app for about 2 weeks, so I definitely haven't tested everything yet, but when it comes to the essentials, I really like:

- super easy creation of multiple Blocklists
- scheduled sessions that automatically activate the chosen Blacklist during the specified time slot
- availability on both Mac and Windows (I regularly use both systems)

### Testing

And that's pretty much it so far.
Now my workflow looks like this: I have 3 Blacklists prepared (depending on whether I need access to email or not), and the most restrictive one automatically activates from 8:30 AM to 11:30 AM every day. Another thing is that it automatically forces me to plan the most important task the day before. So far, this works quite smoothly; we'll see how long it lasts ðŸ˜€.

## Pay them, it's worth it

Oh, by the way, Freedom is paid, but it offers a 7-day trial. The yearly, premium version (after all the initial discounts) costs around $30, which I think is very reasonable (if you are like me from the past and you have some trouble using paid solutions I recommend trying to overcome it and occasionally trying taking out your wallet, because the difference in quality can be huuuuuge ðŸ™‚).
