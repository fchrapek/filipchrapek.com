Not that Iâ€™m bragging, but I can confidently say that Iâ€™m in world top 10 when it comes to professional, competetive procrastination. Okay, not sure about the world, but in my city Iâ€™m definitely top 5.

As much as itâ€™s nice to brag about this in front of my family, friends, or potential employers (also being a member of the procrastination club often earns me cool things like discounts in McDonaldâ€™s), sometimes it would be nice to check off at least one task from the never-ending *to-do* list.

But what do you do if Jocko Willink isnâ€™t sitting next to you, shouting Full Metal Jacket style, that discipline is the key to freedom? Well, I donâ€™t know, maybe try creating an account on Â **<a href="https://freedom.sjv.io/Wq9dYn" target="_blank">Freedom</a>**.?

## The need

The goal was simple: find a **cross-platform solution that would make it as easy as possible to enter ***deep work*** mode**.

<Callout>
  _Deep work_ is a snazzy term for turning off TikTok and getting down to work ðŸ’€.\
  Ok, the topic is seriously engaging, and if you want to read more, check out <a href="https://calnewport.com/" target="_blank">this</a> author.

The topic taps into my latest, larger interest in automation and just better managing my time, so surely there will be more apps and programs that have recently been running alongside Freedom. Check out [Make](/wpisy/make-doskonale-narzedzie-do-automatyzacji), for example.

## Benefits of Freedom

Iâ€™ve had the chance to use similar solutions in the past (like <a href="https://selfcontrolapp.com/" target="_blank">SelfControl</a>) and therefore I know that such self-blocking quite decently checks out for me.

Yet for some reason, I never stuck with a particular solution for longer, always something was off for me. And since I find myself more and more often just opening a new tab and typing in the _search bar_ **_[mean-and-nasty-site-that-steals-time].com_** basically on autopilot, it was decidedly time to act.

Freedom is super. A very simple and minimalist platform, yet it has everything I was looking for. Iâ€™ve been using this app for about 3-4 weeks, so I definitely havenâ€™t tested everything yet, but in terms of the core, what I like most is:

- ultra-easy creation of multiple **_blocklists_**
- cyclical planning of sessions, which automatically trigger the selected **_blocklist_** in a planned time window
- availability both on Mac and Windows (I regularly use both systems)

### Procrastination, We Thank You

And there we have it â€” thatâ€™s both nothing and everything. Now my workflow is such that I have 3 blacklists prepared (depending on, for instance, whether I need access to email or not), out of which the most restrictive one activates automatically from 8:30-11:30 every day.

Another thing is that it automatically enforces in me the necessity of planning the execution of the most vital task the day before, or possibly on the morning of the same day.

So far, this mode works quite efficiently, weâ€™ll see how long that lasts ðŸ˜€

## Good, Because Itâ€™s Paid

Oh, and Freedom is paid, but it offers a 7-day trial. However, the premium version for a year (after all initial discounts) costs something around 30 dollars, so in my view, itâ€™s very much acceptable (generally, if you, like me once, have a problem with using paid solutions, then unless youâ€™re starving, I recommend trying to push through and sometimes open your wallet, because the difference in quality can sometimes be maaaaassive ðŸ™‚).
