<a href="https://www.make.com/" target="_blank">Make</a> is a no-code tool used for process automation.

If I were to have a shirt with an unsocially acceptable number of buttons undone and clasping my hands in a pyramid, that's the definition I'd give. But since I'm not a fan of either of those, let me just say:

## What is Make

If you already have some experience with linking various apps together, it‚Äôs simplest to compare Make to <a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank">Zapier</a>, which basically does the same thing, only more expensively and less cool üíÄ.

Make is a SaaS (Software as a Service), which allows the integration of various platforms and applications in an ultra-simple way (without coding, you can, for example, hook *Chat GPT* and
*Gmail* together), so you have the option to automate repetitive things that were previously done manually.

Listen, it's 2023. Pandemic, shaman attack on the Capitol in the USA, UFO in Mexico, Elon Musk ploughing the largest social media platform alone ‚Äì time to unfasten the seatbelts, finally start living, and get into automation üòÅ.

Oh, the platform itself looks like this when you log in:

## Quentin Tarantino of Automation

What do Make and *Pulp Fiction* have in common? Naturally, a good script!

***Scenarios***, sticking to the film analogy, are a series of consecutive events. It‚Äôs no different in Make, and such events are specifically called *Modules*.

You can start creating your own scenario completely from scratch or use hundreds of <a href="https://www.make.com/en/help/scenarios/scenario-templates" target="_blank">templates</a>. Naturally, you can modify the templates, so if you're looking for integrations of relatively popular platforms, there's a huge chance that Make has such an integration prepared.

Using a less globally popular app? No problem! Make provides an <a href="https://www.make.com/en/help/tools/http" target="_blank">HTTP</a> module, which allows you to use essentially any solution, as long as it provides an API connection. (Here)[/wpisy/automatyzacja-fakturowania-notion-infakt-make] I give an example of integrating Make with Polish Infakt.
