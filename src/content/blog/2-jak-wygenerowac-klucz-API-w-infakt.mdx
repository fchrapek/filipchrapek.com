1. You log into your Infakt account.

2. In the **_Settings_** section (gear icon in the top right corner), you find the **_API_** item in the lower part of the right sidebar.

3. You add (or not) a key description, enter the password, optionally change the scope of permissions, and click **_Generate_**.

4. You shave your head and grow a mustache, have your family call you Heisenberg, and thanks to Infakt's API, you write a program that handles millions in profit from your completely legal car wash in 3 seconds.

   Itâ€™s worth mentioning that this is an optional point.
